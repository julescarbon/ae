Yesterday I decided I'm dropping out, I'll be working on a degree in philosophy, but I'm very frustrated because I'm not too bad at designing actually, and I wasted a few years, also I come from a working class family and university has basically ruined us, it's just nerve wracking and it's got me nowhere.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Ae</strong>, what do you think about architecture and music, not in the sense that music could be a construction of space, but in the sense that designers in general, not just architects, can have different ways of installing an order in a given place, or even inventing orders from preexisting conditions, and music can be structured in similar ways? I mean, the different approaches to form, and the many possible kinds of orders behind form, imply lots of things and you can sort of make a big deal out of them, so how do you approach structure? I mean, scrap the part about architecture, I just wanted to ask about form and structure.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I agree that architects are full of shit, by the way...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, could you tell me something about 4-op FM synths? I know it's a silly question (at least it's not as pretentious as the others) but I'm really attached to my DX21...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>yeah the 4-op model lends itself well to some kinds of modelling and i think its cos of the number of surfaces and their diff harmonics roughly correlating with a physical object</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>structure i dunno i just try to make things that appeal to me stylistically, a bit like sketching out some graffiti (i never tried any other kind of design or drawing much, i got pretty into messing with letters, maybe the rules of form appealed to me)</p> <p>music is a bit like that, at least the kind of music i like that has usually some sense of movement in space to it, it's usually fairly restricted structurally and i like flexing the structures but not quite breaking them, it creates a kind of tension</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:50:10 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="feltcher" data-cid="2083905" data-time="1383424854"> <div> <p>During the Oversteps warehouse gig in London I swear I heard the drums from "Lcc" at one point.&nbsp; My mate passed out in the skanky portaloo's at the back after Haswell's insane set and missed the entire show.

I am thinking of this very often while listening to your music:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Do you spend a lot of time choosing and crafting reverbs for your tracks? Or is it something that you make intuitively - not thinking too much?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am asking because many of your tracks like Xylin Room or Tilapia sounds fairly dry on the first listening but yet they have very distinct vibe and depth as if some super-gentle reverbs and delays were used to craft the space as there are no obvious echoes and reverb tails. Xylin Room sounds claustrophobic yet very 3D but the mix is almost mono. Tilapia sounds very spacious, some sounds are distant but again it has this vacuum feel into it. I simply absolutely love it (not even mentioning the incredible compostion). This question unanswered seriously affects my sleeping everytime I mix some "to be dry" track but if some "secret" techniques are involved I will respectfully and diligently continue trying to achieve it by myself :-)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Please, take this question also as my big "thank you" for your incredible work and tons of inspiration and emotions you gave me.

The possibilities of aural combinations and sound-scapes are virtually endless now with computers, which can be quite scary when you step up to a blank slate.

I often find out that stuff that I <u>really enjoy</u> making at night often suck a lot when listening in to them in daytime. Obviously it has something to do with how brain works. Do you know this situations too? How do you "combat" it? Are you limiting yourself in this situations when to do music and when not?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another question,</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I know that you used to, lets say, "not use deliberately" musical theory approach with your music when composing. But have you ever been in a composition of a track that you could not figure out at all (because of so many notes in complicated compositions on different tracks and so on) that you had to use some of the classical, methodological approach to complete your track? For example looking up the scales for notes in question? Or is it mostly trial and error? OR you have developed some software that can check it for you?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Again, excuse my English.</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. yeah night tracks are just different to day tracks</p> <p>i find the deeper stuff works better at night</p> <p>no idea why, i just make both kinds of tracks and that's that really</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. it depends on how we're working. &nbsp;if it's some rule based thing then it can take care of itself usually, but we might still tweak events here and there if we think it needs it. otherwise we just go by feel. &nbsp;it's not like there are many options to try out with there only usually being 12 notes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Interesting, L-Event is very night-time stuff for me. It seems to not have enough impact during daytime, especially Osla for n. I mean I can hear the, lets say, compisitional logic in those tracks during daytime but at night real emotions come into it and everything seems more enjoyable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of my theories is that brain tends to make up more things into the tracks yet in reality those things are not there. I mean sleep has to have effect on the brain comparable with passing out because that is how brain defends itself and the body so that you don't feel pain anymore etc. So maybe the brain is making up things to "sound better" then they really are?

Especially when that stimulation is hard to vocalise or simply emote to or physically express?<br /> For example, sometimes when I really love something and find it intangibly stimulating, I find that I have no way to express it to people (a description can't really express 'that thing') - do you ever get this kind of frustration?

How can you be satisfied, because everything escapes you. You know that perfectly well. You know that even if you’re in love with somebody, everything escapes you. You want to be nearer that person, but how can you cut your flesh open and join with the other person? It’s an impossibility to do."</blockquote> <br /> Yeah well, i get that, but its a normal human thing right?, to want to rinse the things you love so much for all it may have. With inspiration, i see it as similar, that it can simply be something transferring from a persons one idea to another, like the film effect u mention.

Especially when that stimulation is hard to vocalise or simply emote to or physically express?<br /><br /> For example, sometimes when I really love something and find it intangibly stimulating, I find that I have no way to express it to people (a description can't really express 'that thing') - do you ever get this kind of frustration?

Thank you very much. So if you disregard vinyl mastering for this question would his impact on the final sound be also as significant? I mean, there is really a thin line between what needs actual mastering (not just check of an engineer if the record sounds good) and what not. So I always wondered if there were times when he, for example, gave you an advice on how to mix something problematic in you tracks properly to simply make it sound better (to underline the emotions in the track, make it bigger or whatever) or if he really fixed some track that you two were not capable of pushing the right way. Sometimes a master sounds almost identically to a final mix but sometimes there is a big difference that makes a real impact on the track. So were there any situations like this?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>we learn from their actions of tempering a final mix for cd/dig/vinyl, and work to get the differences minimised for next time, but usually they really don't want to tread all over our thing. but they're really important to us when were at that stage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>mastering engineers - or good ones - are pretty good at quickly spotting a situation that can cause problems, they do it all day everyday loads of styles come their way so they have a great non-interfereing overseer role. as long as they don't go trying to make 'creative decisions'.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>yes theres been plenty of situations where its been done right and wrong, luckily were using noel and so far he's been great.</p> <br /> <p class="edit"> <strong>Edited by Rob Ae, 05 November 2013 - 05:39 AM.</strong> </p> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:49:22 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="21B" data-cid="2086226" data-time="1383651117"> <div> <p>could you gently prod at mat steel to release a solo album?</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>yeah i'd love this, maybe he would use more than one chord</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:49:22 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="amni" data-cid="2086239" data-time="1383652139"> <div> <p>I was thinking about the popularity of the DJ and that the future clubs could well not have DJs but computers with a distict style of music and you woud go to the club that played the style you liked.

Editing is of course inevitable after that most of the time but you know what I mean.</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>yeah i think the screen gets in the way</p> <p>the sequencers that we build ourselves don't have much visual feedback at all, fwiw</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So you have made your sequencers and mapped it to midi controllers and control it hands on? I mean I don't mind screen that much, the mouse is the problem most of the time when composing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I mind screen when mixing, so I turn it off often when making judgement but can't do completely without it - and closing my eyes does not work for me because I feel like I am concentrating too much and lot of other thoughts comes almost instantly :-)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>well kind of yeah, our own seqs have varying degrees of control, and we sometimes use midi input to alter params (the seq is doing the actual pattern gen but might have some variables)</p> <p>the mixing aspect is entirely controllable usually, altho it can be automated</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>only time i use a screen really is to check things like position or whether a param is on that i'm not on the right page for with my interface, or when i'm editing, which is later and obv requires a screen</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I see. So you use something similar like Mackie Control Universal Pro for mixing? I am thinking about such interface for mixing but I can't really imagine controlling EQ and compression with it if resolution of knobs (or steps) isn't good and flexible enough. And neither I want to use hardware processors for this as I see them as a pain to use with 40 + tracks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>nah i'm using a kenton killamix mini atm</p> <p>i only have 8 channels running usually</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>but i also have a bcr2000 here for bigger tasks</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hm, that leads me to a possibility I am not very economic with my projects' housekeeping (track count, number of FX etc.). So you are completely able to do EQ and compression stuff with killamix? Is it sending midi or something with better resolution? Or are you doing just rough adjustments to processors and then do more polishing with mouse?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am sorry if I am asking something really boring and basic.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>yeah the killamix is just for setting things quickly, we have finer control on screen &nbsp;- and internally (there's a fair degree of self-management going on using conditionals)</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:54:42 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="feltcher" data-cid="2086318" data-time="1383657327"> <div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="Sean Ae" data-cid="2086314" data-time="1383657043"> <div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="feltcher" data-cid="2086305" data-time="1383656711"> <div> <p>I went to see Underworld at Brixton academy in 2008, they recorded (professionally) the whole gig then released it straight afterwards as a limited edition 2CD set.&nbsp; In fact they did this for every gig of the whole tour - <a href="http://underworldlive.spinshop.com/CDs/details/109397?parent_url=http%3A%2F%2Funderworldlive.spinshop.com%2F" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">LINKY</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A fantastic memento of the gig, and you could probably do it in such a way that only ticket holders could get a copy of the CD (initially...)</p> <p>Thoughts on this process?

Therefore people would differentiate in levels of objectivity and genius in art is nothing but the highest level of objectivity in the interpretation of the reality with an ability to convert it in consumable form of art. What helps this artist to achieve that highest level is comprehension/ cognition/ of the reality as parts of things and ideas separate from himself in every sense, and as such they can be viewed objectively, and then he can cognize them freely by unconscious reasoning and conscious recognition as ‘true’ .... He feels/knows that there is something worthwhile and follows it to see where it will lead him. It is desire for knowledge and thirst for the truth that push him, and he would not have required motivation if he doesn’t believe that the reality is ‘pretty’ and interesting, like a fractal.</p> <p>Furthermore he/they can name a project Autechre which is also seen as something separate from him/them or at least as an intersection halfway between Reality and his/their own personality/subjectivity. When the artist comes to this intersection he brings to the table things like: psychological openness to knowledge, intellectual ability, lateral horizon of ideas (the main requirement of creativity) , taste / aesthetic preferences, morality (yes, I do think so) , perseverance, diligence , precision, technical skills, time, money, etc…but gains more of the objectivity as an award so he can enjoy the reality even more. It’s a feedback loop actually IMO. That's why <span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">genius has the most benefit from his ingenuity... He knows it when he sees it.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p>Today, all call for relativism and subjectivity like it’s the holly grail of in cognition. Less and less ppl believe in One Objective Reality. Everyone just wants to selfishly ‘‘Express themselves’’ but have not much to show ... if they have they wouldn’t want it. This is also a feedback loop. Someone upstairs have a great sense of humor I guess…</p> <p>I know that not everybody has all the&nbsp;ability but I'm actually talking about morality in art. One can only resonate with what he is.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only artist i could compare you to is Beethoven, lots of reasons (the only artist i love more than you guys [sorry, sorry]). Non could beat him in morality.</p> <p>Interestingly, Beethoven was the first romantic, one could ask how romanticism can be 'objective', especially him? It's not music that has to be objective at first IMO but the composer behind it and you'll see objectivity in the music eventually. Big subject, could wright for days. Sorry for this... i feel like a total dush ...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>:</p> <p>Do you think that tilting in favor of the objectivity in oppose to focusing on self- expression <span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">stripped of Reality </span></span>is possible to be the norm again (as it was in time of classicism) and should it?&nbsp;</p> <p>I don't assume it should be black or white but still in general… what are your thoughts about it?</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>i don't think about it too much tbh</p> <p>it seems like both of these states (objective/subjective) are impossible to achieve, and really we are all some combination of the two</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:53:53 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="mcbpete" data-cid="2086347" data-time="1383659147"> <div> <p>Did you ever go to Jive Turkey ?<br /><br /> <iframe id="ytplayer" class="EmbeddedVideo" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://youtube.com/embed/TmVxxH6tnh4?html5=1&amp;fs=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe></p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>nah we were in manchester then</p> <p>and i was only 16 in 88 and looked even younger, i couldn't even get into a lot of places</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:53:53 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="jules" data-cid="2086349" data-time="1383659249"> <div> <p>a lot of the art in my office has a typography theme. would you say this wall fits right in?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" onload="lzld(this)" onerror="lzld(this)" data-src="http://i42.tinypic.com/20t1p41.jpg" alt="20t1p41.jpg" /></span></p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>oh that's nice</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 09:53:53 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="rd1994" data-cid="2086352" data-time="1383659341"> <div> <p>hi there<br /> multiple questions, again (I think some of them have been overlooked<br /> 1.have you heard of atmogen?

But I think (naively?) that dreams have this very direct connection with the subconscious, this really direct resonance with thoughts that basically nothing else really does, but tunes can really reflect this. Not looking for specific examples per se but could you describe an experience where you made a track and you really recognized the ideas or sensations from a dream?

I've told the story on here before, years ago, but when I was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy I used to practise self-hypnosis as a way of dealing with the crippling nausea. This would usually result in me falling asleep, but one time I left my body &amp; found myself in what appeared to be a spaceship. There were 2 people there who conversed with me &amp; explained what they were doing to me. Unfortunately I can't recall our entire conversation but I do remember them making me feel very welcome. After introductions they asked me if I wanted to meet their "pilot" - a sentient computer housed in a basketball-sized sphere. They told me to look into a laser aperture, which is how the computer would communicate with me. Once I did so, I got the image of a woman with the head of an eagle, which I believe was the computer's image of herself. She "downloaded" all of my thoughts instantaneously; I'm not sure if any information was sent my way, as all I remember of the experience is a blistering rush of imagery. I didn't see the people on the ship after that - I returned to my body &amp; woke up shortly thereafter, feeling very convinced that it was not a dream.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I didn't tell anyone about the experience for years (except for one online friend) until I read The Cosmic Trigger by Robert Anton Wilson, where he mentions a spaceship piloted by a hawk-headed man (I still think it's a woman) who beams people with a red laser &amp; calls itself SPECTRA. There's also mention of a robotic voice that called kids in the 50's and convinced them to become scientists. Naturally, I was excited to learn that other people have "met" the computer &amp; started telling people what had happened to me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, my questions are: &nbsp;have you ever heard of this happening to anyone, besides reading about it in Valis &amp; The Cosmic Trigger? Also, do you think the ship's passengers are humans from the future, or from another star system (I've heard people say they're from the Pleiades).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks for reading, and Rob - I appreciate you tagging my Confield poster!</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>i don't know anyone in person who's experienced this, sounds brilliant. i've had friends experience UFOs thats about it really.</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="YELLOW" data-cid="2086448" data-time="1383665685"> <div> <p>I stated in another thread spl9 was the hardest track you've done since gantz graf, would you agree or is there unreleased Ae that would prove me wrong?<br /><br /> What question from interviewers really gets under your skin?<br /><br /> What is your opinion on SAW 85-92?<br /><br /> Last video game you played?</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>yeah there are way harder tracks we didn't release</p> <p>just been talking about one today funnily enough</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>i like most of 85-92 a lot</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>last game i played was tempest on atari anthology on iphone</p> <p>still not sure about the controls but i wasn't near a computer so it'll do</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>edit: i wasn't avoiding that q2 my brain stopped me from reading it, hmm</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>well - i'm past the point where it actually bothers me but the whole 'how do you usually make a track?' thing got old pretty fast</p> <br /> <p class="edit"> <strong>Edited by Sean Ae, 05 November 2013 - 09:49 AM.</strong> </p> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Rob Ae</th><td> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="phudoshin" data-cid="2086454" data-time="1383665928"> <div> <p>The hembsy pontins set sounds like the Glasgow arts-chool set (2007) but put through an "autechreizor"........I mean its more twisted and glitchier.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Was this a sound system thing. hardware thing or both?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>..............and do you listen to your past live shows like "we do"?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I drive an hour to work each way every day and your sets &nbsp;are bloody perfect especially on a cold winters evening!</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>hardware was essentially the same - slightly newer incarnations, and the set rewritten to some extent. also i remember the hems by being one of the first few of that later kind - more unknown quantity vs tests, whereas the glasgow was deeper within the earlier tour - more experience vs more recklessness mbe</p><br /><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="azatoth" data-cid="2086455" data-time="1383665947"> <div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="Rob Ae" data-cid="2086446" data-time="1383665611"> <p>- zest bar (deodorized soap)</p> </blockquote> <br /> Was it good?

Or even the occasional track / "noodle"?</p> <p>- Are you creating your G2 patches from scratch or do you sometimes use parts from the great patches from users on electro-music.com (such as e.g. the awesome stuff <a href="http://electro-music.com/g2patches.php?owner=Tim%20Kleinert" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Tim created</a>)?</p> <p>- Sean said you'd use reverbs on the G2: I assume they're home-cooked... Any nice tips/tricks on working with reverb on the G2?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, can you name my G2 keyboard?</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>yeah the engine, not the kbd.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>not in use much recently, really more as a synth. there was some sequencing, sometimes whole tracks. all from scratch. its quite patch/voice intensive making home made verbs in there even with the voice double card, esp as the module sounds so good and metallic.</p> <br /> <p class="edit"> <strong>Edited by Rob Ae, 05 November 2013 - 10:56 AM.</strong> </p> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="rekosn" data-cid="2086542" data-time="1383670083"> <div> <p>mouse it baby!</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>lel</p> <p>drag that note length baby</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="Obel" data-cid="2086546" data-time="1383670333"> <div> <p>Do you guys do any DJ sets?

(for example, you didn't do anything to be born as Sean Booth or Rob Brown and as a result grew up in circumstances that made you the Autechre) And that this gift can be used either for transmitting the light of God (as a source of good, order and love) &nbsp;through the prism of your person and character, either for transmitting "energies" of God's enemy, wich perverts your gifts into opposite to God's forces</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am asking you this because for me it's quite interesting to listen your music from this perspective - i feel a lot of dialogues of good and evil in it, especially in your early works - the most bright album from this point is Chiastic Slide, and the most dark is Confield.

Long time fan from Norway here. Big thanks to you guys for doing this, and of course thanks to watmm and Joyrex for making this happen! So some questions from the top of my mind (haven’t read through the whole thread so sorry if some have been asked earlier) So let’s jump straight in, shall we:&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Which book(s) are you currently reading (if any)? Are you mostly into fiction or do you read non-fiction as well, such as philosophy/science/documentary stuff etc?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Any philosophers from any time period you are specifically into?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Salvador Dali or M.C. Escher?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Do any of you speak a foreign language? Do you know any phrases or longer sentences in Japanese?</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">-&nbsp; Are the chopped up robot sounding voices in Lentic Catachresis (sounds like a bunch of droids/machines/robots having some kind party, then it goes mental) sampled from any album or is it like field recorded samples? Have you ever used your own voices in any tracks (if yes, do you mind revealing which ones)? And who are the female voice used in Second Scepe?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Did you sample any actual bell-like instrument for Parhelic Triangle? This track have so much substance, but yet a sense of creepy paranoia that I always get lost into it.. like I’m wandering around in a long dark corridor on some alien world with abandoned laboratories around me, where horrible experiments took place along time ago… and there’s some kind of lethal sentient entity (possible a result from one of those experiments) somewhere watching my steps…&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">I see films have been discussed in the thread so here are some film-related questions:&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Are you into Christopher Nolan’s films, like what do you think of Inception? And his revival of the Batman franchise? Opinions on Bane’s voice/accent?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- What do you think of Blomkamp’s last film, Elysium?</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- What do you feel about R. Scott’s return to the Alien universe with Prometheus?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Do you like Monty Python, and if yes, would you like to mention any favourite sketches?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Who would win a match of pool (eight-ball, etc) between Sean and Rob? What about chess? Or othello (reversi)?</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Will you ever come back to Norway for a gig? I really enjoyed your set in Oslo during the Oversteps tour. If I’m not mistaken that was the first time you ever performed in Norway? How did you like the visit?&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">- Speaking of which… did you know that Pule actually means ”to f*ck” in Norwegian? (I really like the track btw, it has a feeling of rusty dryness to it, in a meditative calming way kind of)</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Ok that was that! I really hope you’ll take your time to reply, but I see you have a hell of a job digging through all these posts!&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">(Oh and btw, I really appreciate your good sense of wit and irony you are expressing throughout this discussion! there seems to be a great vibe of light-heartedness going on between you guys and your fans!)&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Cheers!&nbsp; :)</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">regards, Jan from Norway</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>oh and one more thing I wanted to ask: I was happy to discover that you included a few tracks by Yello in your Exai webcasts. Yello was the band who first triggered my music interest as a kid (when I for the first time saw the music video for rubberbandman on MTV, still remember it as it was yesterday.. ahh... memories... My friends thought my music taste was a bit strange. ah well anyway..)</p> <p>Any favouroite albums/tracks by Meier and Blank?

I want to ask about all that complexity in your music. Is it something purely to keep the mind interested, or do you both find it the best way to communicate that deeper artistic intention behind Autechre as a whole? Being a synesthete myself, looking at the context of the artwork and album track flows, a lot of it suggests a kind of synergistic communication - you mentioned Autechre being bigger than the both of you consciously and I found this a fascinating statement. I know how hard it is to put stuff like an artistic vision into words, but many of your tunes literally go all over the place and I'm curious how that connects with the intention that seems to be going on behind all that work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. Your music has the strangest intricate combination of hard and soft, dry and wet, fat steady beats and arrythmic cacophonia. It's clear from most of your posts and your music that you are ultra-committed to getting your production process just the way you want it. Do you ever feel like you lose track of your musical output?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3. In some of your work, you seem to make a thing out of hiding or disrupting melodical content, in the midst of percussion or disharmony/microtonality (An example would be the post 4 minute mark of Lcc on <em>Untilted</em>, it's like you're intentionally bordering on breaking the track). What's up with that?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks for doing this to the ridiculous extent that you have.</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. it's not about intention. &nbsp;well it kind of is in a way, but our intention is to interact with the world in a way that makes stuff that we like appear. &nbsp;there is no deeper intention or thing that we're trying to accomplish beyond that</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. production is music, all the same thing</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3.i don't think of it as hiding. &nbsp;and pretty much every sound we use is tuned, technically the whole thing is melodic</p> <br /> </td></tr><tr><th valign='top'>Sean Ae</th><td> <!--cached-Sat, 09 Nov 2013 10:07:56 +0000--><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote" data-author="Schlitze" data-cid="2088040" data-time="1383769261"> <div> <p>When you guys are on tour do you ever get to an unfamiliar venue, look around the place and have any concerns about how good it's gonna be? or do you put all your faith in the organisers to get the right venue? or get pissed off at a venue change at towns you've played in previous years? I saw you in glasgow 2005 and 2008 which were at the Art school (organised by Numbers i think), great venue, and the sound was massive. Then in 2010 at Sub Club, still a great gig, but a much smaller venue, more intimate and more subdued atmosphere (lots of chin strokers there that night / monday night, in comparison to Art School where the crowd can get a bit mental down the front {chanting ''one more tune'' i recall, lol}). I guess if i was on tour and had played a couple of gigs in a great venue, and was ready to go back there a coupla years later only to be told ''we're moving you somewhere less epic, you'll have to turn the volume down a bit, it's a monday night'' i'd be a bit pissed off.

I happen to speak that dialect actually. Lot's of the vocabulary in our dialect consists of single vowels, like for instance the sentence " æ e fra Norge" means "I'm from Norway" Actually the æ vowel existed in Old English, as in words such as&nbsp;<i>æsthetic&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>encyclopædia.&nbsp;</i>Reminds me off.. .isn't the track name "dael" from tri repetae actually an old English word, "dæl", meaning "part" or "unit". In Norwegian the word for "part" is "del".

The wealth of information here is tremendous. Thanks for giving us all a little peek behind the curtain for a few days.<br /><br /> I noticed a mention of physical modeling and how you said you can achieve the same sorts of formant / vocal sounds using things like band-pass filters and pulse width modulation. I was listening to "Osla for n" again (incredible) and thought of the formant growling throughout the track, later being gated into more of a 4/4 groove. Is this the type of formant control you were referring to, as something you can do in Max without needing a physical modeling synth, or was much of the formant shaping of the sound already present in the source material? My apologies if I'm interpreting what I'm hearing incorrectly.<br /><br /> Any other question I could think of has already been answered, and I apologize if this was already touched-on.

So I could just use a knob box instead of the controller, though, as you say, the programmer is pretty cute.
